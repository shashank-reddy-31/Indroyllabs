# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm install react-qr-code
The installation to insert QRCode in the react.


1) The project begins with setting up a basic React application and managing state with useState and useEffect hooks.
2) A simple user interface is designed to display questions and player information across computer and mobile views.
3) Questions are hardcoded with multiple-choice answers (A, B, C, D), establishing the foundation for player interaction.
4) A QR code is generated for players to scan, seamlessly connecting them to the game on their mobile devices.
5) Players enter their names upon joining via mobile, and these names are stored and displayed in the application.
6) The current question and answer options are dynamically updated on both screens using conditional rendering.
7) Mobile users can select and submit their answers, which trigger feedback on both screens based on the correctness of their responses.
8) Game logic, including player management and question handling, is effectively managed through React's state management features.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
